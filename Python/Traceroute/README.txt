Project 3 – Traceroute
Patrick Stumbaugh

How to run:

(Using Mac, Python3): 
On the command line, enter: 
sudo python3 IcmpHelperLibrary.py
(You may be prompted for your computer’s password).
You will need root access privileges to run this program.

(I have not tested on a windows OS, though I believe you will still need root privileges to do so)

At the bottom of the script, you’ll find the “main” section. Uncomment out different lines to test different items.
