Project 4 - Client/Server Chat 

How to start program:
(NOTE - Must use Python3)
1. Start the server first:
    In the command line, type in "python3 server.py"
2. Start the client second:
    Open a new terminal (leave the server one going)
    In the new terminal's command line, type in "python3 client.py"

The client side will compose and send the first message. 
Hit enter to send. 
Type "/q" to quit program (this will close both the client and server)
