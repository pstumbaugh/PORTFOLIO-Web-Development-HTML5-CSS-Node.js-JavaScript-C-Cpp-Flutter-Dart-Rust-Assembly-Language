This website was built as a Web Design class project. 

It is a website designed to inspire Portland area hikers to check out some of my favorite spots, broken into three types: Waterfalls, Dog-Friendly and Short Hikes.

I built this webpage from scratch, designing the layout and creating the content. I also did all the coding for HTML, CSS and Javascript (see notes for code portions adapted from outside sites). 

There is also a version built using Node.js and some modules, however those are hosted on a private OSU network, unavailable to the public. 

On the "About Me", there is a form that is live. Feel free to use it to send me an email message. Thank you for visiting!
