              Angels Rest is one of the more popular short hikes in Oregon, but it's that way for a reason!
              <br><br>Start out at the trailhead, near Multnomah Falls, and head upwards! Yes, it's a climb all the way, but it's gradual, so it's really not that bad.
              <br><br>As you get about halfway up the hill, the trees start opening to display views of the gorge! Then, the views become panoramic when you hit the top. Take a minute and breath it all in.
              <br><br>You'll notice burned trees, where a fire blew through many years ago. Those trees stand now among plentiful new life, making for an unforgettable scene.
              <br><br>Sure, you may be wondering why I classified this as a "short hike". The answer being you can do it easily in half a day. It's not that hard and it's a quick there and back. I've done this hike, albeit at a quick pace, in 2 hours while still being able to enjoy the views.
              <br><br>Do note, this is a very popular hike, so get to the trailhead early if you want a parking spot.

              Head on up to Mt. Hood for this stunning lake loop! My recommendation is to do some tent camping at the Trillium Lake Campground, but if you can't be sure to still visit this quick and easy loop.
              <br><br>Trillium Lake is a mountain lake, surrounded by forest land and Mt. Hood to the North. From the south shore of the lake, near the parking lot, you'll get sweeping views of the mountain. It's also a great spot for some night pictures of the mountain, where you can spot Timberline Lodge's lights flickering.
              <br><br>Head out either direction on the trail around the lake, stopping to check out massive old growth trees or to feed the ducks on the side.
              <br><br>When you're done hiking, jump out into the cold lake! It's a great refresher. Or better yet, bring a kayak or canoe to paddle around.
              <br><br>Bring your binoculars if it's in the winter! On a clear day, you'll be able to see skiers and snowboarders along the groomed routes of Timberline Lodge.

              NOTICE: Because of the COVID-19 outbreak, Ape Cave is closed to visitors. Check with the <a href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/alerts/giffordpinchot/alerts-notices/?aid=56793">Gifford Pinchot National Forest</a> for updates.
              <br><br>Heading on up north, this time into Washington, as the foot of Mt. St. Helens, we find Ape Caves. This cave was formed from lava flow about 2,000 years ago.
              <br><br>Bring a flashlight, headlamp, whatever emits light! You're going to need it! Don't forget those extra batteries too! There are no lights in this cave. It's up to you to light the way.
              <br><br>If you're looking for an easier, family-friendly cave adventure, head toward the lower cave (both caves have the same entrance point). It's fairly flat, for about a mile down until it gets too small, in which you'll have to turn around.
              <br><br>For those of you more adventurous, tackle the upper cave! It's only a mile, but it will take a you a couple hours to get to the end. You'll be rock scrambling, crawling at times, even climbing up a (small) rock wall with the help of a rope ladder.
              <br><br>It's pitch black all the way until the end (except for one hole in the ceiling about .75 miles in). Then, you'll find a ladder to get you out of the cave. From there, it's a mile hike back to the parking lot.
