              Hello! My name is Pat Stumbaugh. <br>
              <br> I love hiking in the Portland area with my two dogs, seen here. Harper is the silly Golden Retriever, who loves everyone and everything. She won't pass up the opportunity to say hi to every hiker we pass! Waldo, on the other hand, is very determined. He's always looking ahead and won't let anything stop him, except perhaps a quick dip in the river. <br>
              <br> The three of us hike and camp around the Portland area and throughout different parts of our beautiful state. I'm not much of a long-distance hiker, as you're more likely to find me searching for the best waterfall or a good stop for lunch at. I don't mind, as it's the journey that I enjoy! <br>
              <br> I also love getting out on the water. You'll find me on a lake in the summer, paddleboarding with friends. Sometimes Harper can even come along! <br>
              <br> When I'm not hiking, you can find me either working or studying. I work for a local television station as a Production Director. Essentially I get to push all the buttons and make things happen on tv! <br>
              <br> I'm also currently studying Computer Science through Oregon State University. That's part of the reason this website exists! I built it from scratch, and I'm pretty proud of it too. <br>
              <br> I've lived here in Portland now for 6 years! It's certainly one of my favorite places to be. I've also lived in:
              <ul class="livedList">
                <li>Knoxville, TN</li>
                <li>Spokane, WA</li>
                <li>San Francisco, CA</li>
                <li>Palm Springs, CA</li>
              </ul>
              <br> I would love to hear from you! Tell me your favorite place to hike, or perhaps a hike I don't feature here that you think should make the list! <br>
              <br> If you're looking for more hikes, or perhaps trail guides, visit one of my favorite sites, <a href="https://www.oregonhikers.org">Oregon Hikers</a>.
