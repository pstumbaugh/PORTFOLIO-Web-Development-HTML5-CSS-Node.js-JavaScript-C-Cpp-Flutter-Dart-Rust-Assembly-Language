              Silver Star Mountain is one of the best places to get the five-peak view. Mt. Rainier, Mt. Adams, Mt. St. Helens, Mt. Hood and Mt. Jefferson are easily within view at the top on a clear day. It is absolutely stunning!
              <br><br>While getting to the trailhead on dirt roads may take a while, the trail is well worth it. Bring your water, as there is a pretty good uphill climb ahead of you. Over 2,000 feet of elevation gain, to be more precise.
              <br><br>This is another great higher-altitude trail to spot wildflowers! There are tons of variety spread out across the peak of this mountain.
              <br><br>The first half of the hike up is fairly wooded, take your time as you have a long climb to go. Once you get halfway, it opens up and you can see for miles! From then, you'll hike along ridgelines until you reach the highest peak, Silver Star Mountain.

              Elk Meadows is a great hike along the east face of Mt. Hood. There are many popular routes in this area, so be sure to use a map when visiting.
              <br><br>Have fun crossing small streams (my dog Waldo loves to sit down in every one of them!), exploring old-growth trees and having a lunch alongside a meadow with Mt. Hood as the backdrop.
              <br><br>This is a great hike for dogs and families who enjoy hiking. It's nothing too hard and the experience is great.
              <br><br>There is one section of the hike, after crossing the main river, that heads uphill for about a mile. Don't get discouraged, as the meadow is half a mile past that!
              <br><br>Be sure to bring your camera, the views will not disappoint!.

              Beacon Rock is a great, short, dog-friendly hike to do with friends! Beacon Rock was once the core of a volcano. At 848-feet tall, it's one of the tallest monoliths in the United States!
              <br><br>From the parking lot, follow the trail until you reach the Beacon Rock gate, about .25 miles in. From there, you'll hike switchbacks, all carved out of the rock (with handrails too) until you nearly reach the top.
              <br><br>These switchbacks were originally built by Henry Biddle and Charles Johnson between 1915 and 1918. In fact, the name Beacon Rock comes from Lewis & Clark on their Voyage of Discovery in 1805. It was briefly renamed Castle Rock, but the original name was restored in 1916.
              <br><br>Once at the top, enjoy panoramic views of the Columbia River, as it winds between Oregon and Washington.
              <br><br>You'll probably want to bring a jacket, it's always very windy along the side of Beacon Rock!

              Think of Jenkins Estate as a bonus trail! This one is near my house, so I tend to fancy it as a quick getaway.
              <br><br>The property is a collection of historic buildings and gardens. I enjoy taking my dogs on the apx. 2 miles loop around the outside of the property.
              <br><br>This outer-loop trail is great as it offers peace among the busy city nearby. Wander down a hill through a small forest of trees, then later walk by the main estate home and stables.
              <br><br>There is also a beautiful Rhododendron garden on the estate, near the main house.
