              Umbrella Falls is a great hike on the backside of Mt. Hood. Enjoy the beautiful waterfall, close-up views of Mt. Hood and of course meadows filled with flowers!
              <br><br>The best time to hike this trail is late summer into fall, when the wildflowers are popping up. If you park near Mt. Hood Meadows, you'll start right next to the falls. From there, you'll start a loop around the meadows.
              <br><br>Follow the Shale Falls Trail for a while in the thick forest. After about a mile, you'll start seeing some meadows! Once you pass the HRM parking lot and Nordic Center, be sure to look for the left turn on to trail 667.
              <br><br> There, you'll start ascending uphill, beware, as it can be quite the climb for some. You'll get great views of Mt. Hood as you hike under the resort's chairlifts.
              <br><br> It may not be that far, but it does take a while to trek, so plan accordingly!

              NOTICE: This trail is closed past Ponytail Falls until further notice because of damage from the 2017 Eagle Creek Fire. You can do an out and back if you prefer. Please check the list of <a href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/fseprd574101.pdf">Columbia Gorge trail </a>closures before you plan for a hike.
              <br><br>This is just one of the Columbia River Gorge's spectacular waterfalls. If this trail is still closed at the time you're reading this, be sure to check out Multnomah Falls, the neighboring Wahkeena Falls or Bridal Veil Falls down the road. All have several hikes available, or just drive up and look!
              <br><br>This hike begins going up switchbacks to the top of the falls. Don't worry, this is the hardest part of the trail. It flattens out at the top!
              <br><br>Enjoy views of the Columbia River Gorge as you ascend along the beautiful rock walls. Once you reach Ponytail Falls, you're in for a treat!
              <br><br>The first thing you'll do, along with everyone else, is go under the falls. That's right! The trail goes underneath the falls, where erosion has cut out part of the earth. What a spectacular feeling this is to view it from below. The immense sound will remind you the power of mother nature.
              <br><br>Once you're done enjoying the falls, head back down or follow the trail up and around towards Multnomah Falls. You'll eventually arrive at the top. Be sure to go to the lookout area before heading down the trail.

              This is one of my favorites! This trail has it all, from waterfalls, to scenic views of Mt. Hood to crossing rivers! If you're looking for a somewhat challenging hike with everything nature has to offer, this is the hike for you.
              <br> <br>The Ramona Falls hike starts out along the banks of the Sandy River. There used to be a foot bridge, but that was washed away years ago. About a mile in, you'll have to cross the river on a downed log. Small children may not be able to do this.
              <br> <br>After crossing the river, keep to the right, as the trail ascends up a small hill. You'll still be along the river though, so keep enjoying the great views! Be sure to stop and take pictures of Mt. Hood on a clear day!
              <br> <br>You'll then arrive at the falls! I hope you packed a lunch, as it's a great halfway point of the hike to stop for a break and listen to the rushing water. The earlier in the season you go, the better the water flow will be.
              <br> <br>When you're ready to leave, continue down the trail (it's a loop after all) as you go into the forest. This will lead you right back to where the Sandy River crossing log is.
              <br> <br>Do note, this is a very popular trail in the summer months, so get there early to get a parking spot!

              Yes, yes, I know this is a Portland area hiker's guide, but I just had to throw this beauty in. If you're ever near Eugene and have some time to spare, drive out to Salt Creek Falls. You won't be disappointed!
              <br><br>This beautiful waterfall is just off from the parking lot. You'll view it from the side, all the way up near the top. It's one of the best views I've ever seen.
              <br><br>If you're in the hiking mood, I recommend the Diamond Creek Falls loop. You'll start from the Salt Creek Falls parking lot and head up the hillside for about 1.5 miles until you reach Diamond Creek Falls.
              <br><br>You'll get to view the falls, which look very similar to Ramona Falls, from a viewpoint along the side of the cliff. From there, loop back down and follow Salt Creek until you're nearing Salt Creek Falls. You'll go over a pedestrian bridge on the backside of the waterfall.
