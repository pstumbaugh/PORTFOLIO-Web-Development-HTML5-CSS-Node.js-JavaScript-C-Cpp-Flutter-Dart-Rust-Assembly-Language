The goal for this project was to implement the 3 functions (specified in
requirements file) in a continuous integration workflow. My team consisted of
three members, each taking on a specific function. My portion was assigned to
function 2, my_datetime().

Each team member also created a testing suite (inside tests.py) to cover tests
for their assigned function. I did a mix of manual tests along with random
testing.
