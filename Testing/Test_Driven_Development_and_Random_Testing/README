This program tests to see if a password matches a specific criteria (as defined
 below). If the password passes, the function returns true. The
 testing suite will cover calling the function to test.

The function check_pwd.py was developed using Test Driven Development. That is,
 I started with creating tests in tests.py that should fail, then adjusting
 check_pwd.py to check for that failed test and return False.

Tests.py includes both manually created tests as well as random tests (at the
bottom of the testing suite).
