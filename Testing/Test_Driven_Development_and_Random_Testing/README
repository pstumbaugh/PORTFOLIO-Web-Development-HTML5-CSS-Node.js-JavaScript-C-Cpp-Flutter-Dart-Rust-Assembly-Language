This program tests to see if a password matches a specific criteria (as defined
 below). If the password passes, the function returns true. The
 testing suite will cover calling the function to test.

The function check_pwd.py was developed using Test Driven Development. That is,
 I started with creating tests in tests.py that should fail, then adjusting
 check_pwd.py to check for that failed test and return False.

Tests.py includes both manually created tests as well as random tests (at the
bottom of the testing suite).


Requirements:
    check_pwd accepts a string and returns True if it meets the criteria listed
     below, otherwise it returns False:
        Must be between 8 and 20 characters (inclusive)
        Must contain at least one lowercase letter
        Must contain at least one uppercase letter
        Must contain at least one digit
        Must contain at least one symbol from: ~`!@#$%^&*()_+-=
    It is assumed only strings will be passed to check_pwd
