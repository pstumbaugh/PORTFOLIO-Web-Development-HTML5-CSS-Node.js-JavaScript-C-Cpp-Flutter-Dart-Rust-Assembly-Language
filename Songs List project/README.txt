This is a project for a friend of mine who plays different types of church music. He wanted a way to save music he's recorded.

The songs are divided up into different categories. The user opens to a main menu that lists those categories. From there, the user can go into a specific category's 
main menu, in which they will be able to do a number of different options. Per the user I was building this for, some of the categories have unique options.
the others. Common options among all categories include: Add a song, Delete a song, Display song information. 

Some data types differ (per the user's request). That is, some categories save book information about a composer while other categories don't prompt for that information. 

Songs are then saved into a .txt file pertaining to that specific category. Next time the user runs the program, the program will load all the saved
songs from previous entries into a data structure (linked list).
